BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

## Releasing

These are mostly notes for mainteners.

-   Be sure you are starting from a clean slate: `npm run clean && npm install`
-   Run standard-version: `npm run release` - this will run the `ci` task
-   Push to GitHub: `git push --follow-tags origin main`
-   Publish to npmjs.com: `npm publish`
-   Assuming all goes well, head over to https://github.com/KryptaPay/ts-node-pckg-starter.git/releases
    and update the release with any relevant notes. The generated CHANGELOG.md file should
    be updated, so you can use it to document release changes.
